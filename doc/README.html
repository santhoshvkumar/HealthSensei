  <h2 name="important">Important</h2>

  <div style="color: red">The following is recommended</div>
  <div>1) <b>Using this library in a production environment is not recommended</b> until the Google Low Energy API becomes more mature and stable.  Use at your own discretion.</div>
  <div>2) Turn the WiFi off on your Android device.</div>
  <div>3) Do <b>NOT</b> pair your Android to the remote device.</div>
  <div>For more information, see the <a href="#testing">Testing</a> and <a

  <h2 name="history">Version History</h2>
  <div class="sub-section-item">8/12/2013 - Version 1.0</div>
  <div>Initial release</div>
  <br/>

  <div class="sub-section-item">12/18/2013 - Version 1.0.1</div>
  <div>1) getBrspState() now correctly returns the correct
    BRSP_STATE_READY state when ready
  </div>
  <div>2) brsp object raises a more descriptive exception if
    writeBytes is called in any other state than BRSP_STATE_READY.
  </div>
  <div>3) Modified the sample app to show the usage of above fixes</div>
  <div>4) Added App Version menu item that returns current app
    version (Same as library version)
  </div>
  <br/>

  <div class="sub-section-item">1/23/2014 - Version 1.1.0</div>
  <div>
    1) Updated the Menu in the sample app to work properly on smaller screens
  </div>
  <div>
    2) Changed the minSdkVersion in the sample app to support SDK 18 (4.3)
  </div>
  <div><b>Note: No changes were made to the actual library file in this release.</b></div>
  <br/>

  <div class="sub-section-item">11/10/2014 - Version 1.2.0</div>
  <div>
    1) Diconnecting now destroys internal gatt object.  This change fixes unable to reconnect problems in certain situations.
  </div>
  <div>
    2) A new UnstableException is now sent to onError() of BrspCallback when library detect that the bluetooth has become unstable.
    This will occur if disconnect has been called and state changes to connected.
    Cycling the bluetooth here pragmatically may fix the instability most of the time but is not recommended by Google without user permission.
  </div>
  <div>
    3) A 100ms delay has been placed between the internal disconnect and close to prevent Unhandled NullPointerException.
  </div>

  <h2 name="testing">Testing</h2>

  <div>This has been tested on a Nexus 7 2013 model and Samsung S4. The Nexus 4
    should also work but has not been verified. Note: BLE did not work at
    all on a Nexus 7, 2012. (Android version 4.3)
  </div>


  <h2 name="knownissues">Known Issues</h2>

  <div>
    Connecting and disconnecting without enough of an interval between seems to make the bluetooth unstable.  Cycling
    the bluetooth on the device fixes this most of the time.  Occasionally the handset will have to be rebooted.
  </div>
  <br/>
  <div class="sub-section-item">Android 4.4</div>
  <div>1) Pairing is unstable and not recommended, if used on a
    handset with 4.4 Android installed
  </div>
  <br/>

  <div class="sub-section-item">Android 4.3</div>
  <div>1) WiFi seems to cause connections to become unstable. More
    disconnects and possibly other problems can occur if the WiFi is
    turned on.
  </div>
  <div>2) After the first connect, the Bluetooth will have to be
    cycled on your Android to connect to the same device again, or any
    other if paired. Also, a bug in Android OS prevents being able to
    unpair once paired.
  </div>
  <div>
    3) This API <b>only works on our single-mode modules,</b> but not the
    dual modes at this time due to a bug in the 4.3 release of Android
    OS.
